        <p>Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru, was born as Bhai Jetha on 24 September 1534 in Lahore (now in Pakistan). Orphaned at a young age, he was raised by a kind woman who instilled in him the values of hard work and faith. As a young man, he met Guru Amar Das, the third Sikh Guru, and became his devoted disciple. He later married Bibi Bhani, the daughter of Guru Amar Das, and became an integral part of the Guru‚Äôs family. Impressed by his humility, devotion, and dedication to service, Guru Amar Das appointed him as his successor in 1574, giving him the name Guru Ram Das.
 As Guru, he made significant contributions to Sikhism and laid the foundation for what would become the spiritual and cultural heart of the Sikh community. He selected the site for a new settlement and began constructing a sacred tank called Amrit Sarovar, or ‚ÄúPool of Nectar.‚Äù Around this tank grew a town that would eventually become the city of Amritsar. Guru Ram Das encouraged people from various walks of life to settle there, fostering a diverse and thriving community. He also composed numerous hymns that are now part of the Guru Granth Sahib and introduced the Lavan, the four hymns recited during the Sikh marriage ceremony. He institutionalized the practice of Langar (community kitchen) and emphasized service, equality, and devotion. Guru Ram Das passed away on 1 September 1581 and was succeeded by his youngest son, Guru Arjan Dev. His legacy lives on, especially through the city of Amritsar, which stands as a testament to his vision and spiritual leadership.</p>
